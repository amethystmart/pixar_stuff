Here is my Pixar story! I chose some very simplistic data to do this story, which was right before NICAR.

 I wanted easy numbers to work with as this is my first time using Adobe Illustrator, ai2html, and flex boxes in my html. Honestly, I know it isn't that special, but I put a lot of time into it due to having to learn the software from scratch, and I feel like I am just touching the surface of illustrator power. If I could change anything, I would just make it look better, but also, I'm still new so I can't be so hard on myself. I know it's a silly subject but I am obsessed with Pixar films! And so I did what felt fun to me. I can't wait to see what other weird things I can do with illustrator.
